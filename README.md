# Lab Material for Computer Architecture

This repository provides lab material for the 2017
[Computer Architecture and Engineering course (02155)](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/courses/02155/) at DTU.
Although this lab is customized for the DTU course, it can also serve as
introduction lab for computer architecture in general and the RISC-V
instruction set specifically.

The lab is based on COD: [Computer Organization and Design RISC-V Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Organization-Design-RISC-V-Architecture/dp/0128122757):
The Hardware Software Interface, 1st Edition,
by David A. Patterson (Author), John L. Hennessy (Author).

To use this material you can: (1) just browse it online on GitHub,
(2) clone the repo to have all material offline (using it also
for your solutions),
or (3) fork the repo (and clone locally), to be able to contribute back with changes.

**Contributions:** We are happily accepting contributions in the form of
pull requests. Even the fix of a small typo is appreciated.

## Lab Overview

The following list gives an overview of all lab sessions and assignments.
For lab sessions where no link is given, we will provide the material in CampusNet.

 * week 1: Number representation and performance
 * week 2: [Lab 2](lab2)
 * week 3: [Lab 3](lab3)
 * week 4: work on first assignment
 * week 5: [Lab 5](lab5)
 * week 6: [Lab 6](lab6)

## Resources

### RISC-V Simple Simulator

For the first labs we will use the web based RISC-V simulator [Venus](https://kvakil.github.io/venus/).
Venus executes in your browser and there is no need to install any tools
on your laptop. You can also save that web page to have a local copy of
the simulator to work when offline.

### RISC-V C Compiler and Spike

However, for later lab exercises and your final project we need the full RISC-V toolchain, including a port of gcc and the `spike` simulator.

If you are using Ubuntu (or any other Linux version) or a Mac OS X laptop, you can install the tools
natively on your machine. However, to simplify life we provide a virtual machine (VM) with Ubuntu
and all needed tools installed. You need about 18 GB of free disk space for the VM and another
temporary space of 7 GB for the .zip file

 * An Ubuntu VM with RISC-V tools installed
   * [caelab.zip](https://patmos-download.compute.dtu.dk/caelab.zip)
   * user: caelab pwd: caelab
 * Use the free [VMWare Workstation Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html)

Test the VM by opening a terminal and starting the compiler with:
```
riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc
```

You should get an error, similar to following
```
riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc: fatal error: no input files
compilation terminated.
```
which is good as you know the the compiler is installed.
You are now prepared for all RISC-V based lab work and projects.


For the more curious, you can sneak ahead and compile and run 
_Hello World_ program on RISC-V `spike` as follows:
```
echo -e '#include <stdio.h>\n int main(void) { printf("Hello world!\\n"); return 0; }' > hello.c
riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -o hello hello.c
spike pk hello
```

## VM and Tool Installation

This is a log how I prepared the Ubuntu VM for the CAE lab. It might be useful for your own installation of the RISC-V tools.

_Please note that this is a log on how I prepared the Ubuntu VM for the CAE lab.
This instructions might be out of date soon. Please refer to the original README
documents of the RISC-V tools._

 * Use VMware Workstation 15 Player
 * Use Ubuntu 18.04 desktop
 * Do not use VMware easy install
 * Do not use LVM
 * Settings: turn off screen locking
 
Install VM tools for clipboard support and restart VM
```bash
sudo apt install open-vm-tools
```

Install git
```bash
sudo apt install git
```

### Install the RISC-V compiler 32-bit version (riscv32)

Follow the instructions for installing the RISC-V tools [here](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tools),
except do not execute 
```bash
./build.sh
```
Instead, change all references in `build-rv32ima.sh` from `rv32ima` to `rv32i`.
Set the RISCV variable and path by adding this into `.profile`
(including logout and login to update your environment variables):
```
# RISC-V tools
export RISCV=$HOME/riscv-tools
export PATH=$PATH:$RISCV/bin
```
Then run
```bash
./build-rv32ima.sh
```

### Install the RISC-V compiler 32/64-bit version (riscv64)

```bash
sudo apt install gcc-riscv64-linux-gnu
```

### Linker file

Create a file `linker.ld` in the $HOME directory containing the following:
```
SECTIONS {
.text :{*(*)}
}
```

Download the RISCV pipeline simulator Ripes from [here](https://github.com/mortbopet/Ripes/releases).
No installation is required, however, enable the file's execute bit to make it executable.

## RISC-V Tools on macOS

### Ubuntu on macOS

There is no free VMWaare Player available for macOS. You can buy their
[VMware Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html).

An alternative is to use the free VM [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).


### Native Installation on macOS

For diverse GNU tools you need a packet manager for those tools under macOS.

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is one of the popular ones. For the packets
listed in the Ubuntu installation you need to find the related ones for brew/macOS.
As my (Martin's) Mac has brew already installed, I cannot list all that are
needed. But if anyone is doing this installation from scratch I would love
to add this information here.

According to the RISC-V tools README, following Homebrew packages need to be
installed with following command:

```
brew install libusb dtc gawk gnu-sed gmp mpfr libmpc isl wget automake md5sha1sum
```

Then follow the instructions above like the setup on Ubuntu.
